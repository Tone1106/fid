<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into<br> a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,<cite> Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q><em>ultra-low-temperature poaching</em></q>.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us <b>before</b><time datetime="November 30"> November 30</time>.</p>
